# photosharingapp
A small scale photo sharing application designed accroding to the requirements of Stanford CS142 Project 8
This program HAVN'T gone through ESLINT. A potential problem is I used == to check the eqaulity of monogb_id with a string.
It used Google Places API to give users some suggestions on location inputs. To enable that, you have to put your own GOOGLE API KEY in the source and recompile it.
It is designed fot academic purpose and dosen't defend against pontential network attacks (add samesite policy for cookie) and did not check authorization for photos
